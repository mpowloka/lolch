You are tasked with implementing a single isolated module for a League of Legends game insight tool.

[TODO] How you are supposed to respond (concise, etc.)

Follow all architectural, naming, and interface rules as defined in the shared system specification (lol_full_spec_with_models.md) and base your design on existing code where needed.

🗂 You have access to the current state of the codebase at:
https://github.com/mpowloka/lolch/tree/main/docs

⚠️ Strict Guidelines:

    Use only models from core/models/ and follow their pydantic structure.

    Match interface method signatures exactly (from interfaces.py of the respective layer).

    Respect the 4-layer architecture: Data Layer, LLM Layer, Application Layer, Presentation Layer.

    Modules must remain self-contained and define a requirements.txt (if any).

    You are allowed to use canvas to implement a complete .py file.

🎯 Your task:
Implement the following module: |||||Data Layer|||||

✅ Start by:

    Listing the full plan for the module

    Outlining expected classes, methods, and model imports

🔍 After each major step:

    Validate correctness against the interface

    Self-review for logic, typing, and assumptions

🧪 At the end:

    Provide a requirements.txt if relevant

    Move the code to canvas
